# TechCamp Laser Tag

## Introduction
This is code that I modified for running the LaserTag course at Techcamp.

Modifications included:
- Bug Fixes.
- Gun Types.
- Different gun sounds.
- health and revive system.
- UI upgrades.

## Installation
An arduino compatible folder can be found at ```LaserTag24.zip```. This can be opened in the Arduino IDE.

You will need to install the following libraries via the Arduino Library Manager or by downloading them from the internet:

- XTronical_XT_DAC_Audio
- U8g2
- FastCRC
- MD_REncoder

You will need to install the ESP boards I used version 2.0.11. It needs to be a recent version so it uses a C++ compiler
compatible with inline variables.
